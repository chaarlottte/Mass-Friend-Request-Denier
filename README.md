# Mass Friend Request Denier
Did YOU get spammed with friend requests on Discord? OH NO! Luckily, you can undo it in a matter of seconds with this tool!

## Usage
Download & extract everything, navigate into the directory in a terminal, andrun this command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then simply run:

```

And that's it! All incoming friend requests will be denied. Outgoing requests and current friends will be unaffected.
